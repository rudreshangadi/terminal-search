Usage : 
1. Clone into a local repository
2. Run the `setup` file in a terminal as `<path to file>/setup`
3. Close the present terminal or alternatively run `source .bashrc` 
4. For indirect search and to avail other functionality, type `wikipedia_search` in any terminal
5. For direct noise-free search, type `wikipedia_search <name of topic>` in any terminal

Currently under author development: top articles and other home page categories, faulty searches

Proposed changes are given in todo.txt.
