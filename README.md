# terminal-search
A terminal app to search stuff online automatically and display a summary

Currently supported only for wikipedia. Functionality to be increased eventually.

Usage : 
1. Clone into a local repository
2. Open a terminal in the folder with the wikipedia-search file
3. Change `#!<path to interpreter>/python` in line 1 to your local interpreter. 
4. In .bashrc, add `PATH=$PATH:<path to folder>/terminal-search/wikipedia-search`
5. Type `wikipedia_search <name of topic>` in any terminal

Currently under author development: auto detect/use use default browser -> branch auto_browser

Proposed changes are given in todo.txt in each folder.
